## Demo
- [Appetize](https://appetize.io/app/b_j6wju4c2hsenfvoin7ebbnfide)
- Go to releases for the [APK](https://github.com/slowburn-404/HNGInternship/releases/tag/v1.0.1(Malltiverse))

## Features
- List products by category.

## Architecture Overview
- The application utilizes the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern. The Model ([Data layer](app/src/main/java/dev/borisochieng/timbushop/data/)) is responsible for data retrieval from the API and uses the repository pattern.
- The [UI layer](app/src/main/java/dev/borisochieng/timbushop/ui/) wraps the View, which consists of [Activities](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/intro-activities) made up of UI elements called Composables, and the ViewModel, holds the state for the screen (View) and data retrieved from the Model.
